# `gnopls`, the Gno language server

⚠️  `gnopls` is in an experimental phase; use with caution.

[![PkgGnoDev](https://pkg.gno.dev/badge/github.com/gnoverse/gnopls)](https://pkg.gno.dev/github.com/gnoverse/gnopls)

`gnopls` is a modified fork of https://github.com/gnolang/gnopls.
It provides a wide variety of [IDE features](doc/features/README.md) to any [LSP]-compatible editor.

## Editors

### TODO

If you use `gnopls` with an editor that is not on this list, please send us a CL [updating this documentation](doc/contributing.md).

## Installation

For the most part, you should not need to install or update `gnopls`. Your editor should handle that step for you.

If you do want to get the latest stable version of `gnopls`, run the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/gnoverse/gnopls@latest
```
