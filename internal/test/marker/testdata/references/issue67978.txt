This test exercises a references query on an exported method that
conflicts with a field name. This ill-typed input violates the
assumption that if type T has a method, then the method set of T is
nonempty, which led to a crash.

See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/67978.

-- a.go --
package p

type E struct { X int } //@ diag(re"()X", re"field.*same name")

func (E) X() {} //@ loc(a, "X"), refs("X", a, b), diag(re"()X", re"method.*same name")

var _ = new(E).X //@ loc(b, "X")
